CareSRE
AI‑Powered Multi‑Agent System for Intelligent Hospital OPD Management

Problem
Hospital OPDs face long queues, manual triage, overloaded doctors, and poor operational visibility.
Most Hospital Management Systems only store data and do not support real‑time decisions.

CareSRE adds an AI intelligence layer on top of basic hospital workflows to solve this.

What CareSRE Does
CareSRE uses multiple task‑specific AI agents to:

Structure patient intake data

Assign triage priority and OPD routing

Generate OPD tokens with estimated wait time

Monitor crowd load and raise alerts

Provide admin‑level operational insights

This improves queue control, doctor efficiency, and patient experience without replacing clinicians.

Why Multi‑Agent AI
Healthcare workflows are multi‑role and dynamic.
CareSRE uses one agent per responsibility, making the system:

Explainable

Reliable

Scalable

Judge‑safe (decision‑support, not diagnosis)

Core Agents
Patient Intake Agent – structures free‑text symptoms

Triage & Priority Agent – assigns urgency and department

Token & Queue Agent – manages OPD flow and wait time

Alert Agent – detects overloads and exceptions

Admin Insight Agent – generates actionable summaries

Architecture
Frontend: Web UI (Patient / Doctor / Admin views)

Backend: Firebase Authentication + Firestore

AI Layer: Prompt‑based LLM agents (no model training)

Design Principles
Decision‑support, not diagnosis

Modular agent design

Easy integration with existing HMS

Deployable MVP for public hospitals

Future Scope
Expansion beyond OPD (pharmacy, diagnostics)

Analytics dashboards

Multi‑language patient input

Deeper agent coordination

CareSRE is a real‑world, deployable multi‑agent AI system focused on hospital operations, not medical diagnosis.
